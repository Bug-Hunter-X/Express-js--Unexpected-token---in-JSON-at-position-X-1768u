# Express.js Unexpected JSON Token Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes tricky error in Express.js applications: the "Unexpected token } in JSON at position X" error.  This error arises when your server attempts to parse a JSON response that is incorrectly formatted. This often happens because of a missing closing quote or an unexpected character within the JSON string.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an example Express.js server with a route that generates a malformed JSON response. Run this file using Node.js to see the error in action.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the malformed JSON. The solution highlights the importance of carefully checking JSON syntax and using JSON validators to prevent this type of error.

## Learning Points

* **JSON Syntax:**  Always double-check your JSON formatting to ensure correct syntax (quotes, brackets, commas).  A single misplaced character can cause this error.
* **JSON Validators:** Use online JSON validators or integrate one into your development workflow to catch formatting errors early.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your Express.js application to catch and manage these kinds of issues gracefully, potentially providing informative error messages to clients.
